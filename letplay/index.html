<div class="boxed"><h2><p class="large">Graphics</p></h2>
<p class="strong">This is a 16-bit stylized fully colored game. Similar to the NES or Sega Genesis games in graphics. This game is the side scroller. The setting of the first zone takes place in grassland with various flora throughout the zone. The setting of the second zone takes place in the snowy mountains. Contrast to the first zone as a zone is more technologically oriented. For instance, there is a city in the backdrop.</p></div><br>


<div class="boxed"><h2><p class="large">Characters</p></h2>
<p class="strong">At the start of the game the characters that you can choose from are Sonic Knuckles Tails and Cream. Amy and Shadow can be unlocked through a password. The character you choose will be the protagonist. Sonic, Knuckles, Amy and Shadow handle similarly, they are speed oriented. Primary function is to run. Cream and Tails have the ability to fly and they are slightly slower. The main antagonist is Eggman. 
<br>The control of the characters is as follows 
<br>To move forward or to the right press the right arrow key. 
<br>To move backwards or to the left press the left arrow key. 
<br>To jump, press the spacebar. 
<br>To curl up into a ball and roll or performance spin dash hold the down arrow key and press the spacebar. 
<br>Exclusively for Tails and Cream in order to fly repeatedly tap the spacebar; flight is limited, and the characters can become exhausted and fall.
<br>If a character is hurt that individual will lose their rings. If a character has no ringâ€™s and that individual is hurt that persona will die.
<br>Now the password to unlock the two hidden characters and all cheats are 595313131313131.

<div class="boxed"><h2><p class="large">Scenario</p></h2>
 <p class="strong">Players chosen protagonist navigates a maze, fighting various enemy collecting and moving as fast as possible to complete the level.
<br>Time trail is unlocked for player complete after completing a level or with a password. There is no boss battel Time trail.
<br>Eggman appears at the beginning of every three acts or the last level of a zone. There are two zone in this game or six levels.

<div class="boxed"><h2><p class="large">What is your reaction as a twenty-first-century gamer to this late-twentieth-century video game?</p></h2>
<p class="strong">I truly like this game, especially the soundtrack. The vibrant colors add to the appeal for me. The games fast pace did not leave me board in the slightest.</p></div><br>

<div class="boxed"><h2><p class="large">Can you draw any connections between this game and more recent ones?</p></h2>
Yes, I can compare this game to Sonic Mania. Both games are side scroller that allow the player to choose between a multitude of characters to navigate a maze. The rules about characters staying alive with ring if they get hurt is the same.  Both even have a multitude of path in their mazes to in enticing the player to return to play and explore the world further.</p></div><br>
